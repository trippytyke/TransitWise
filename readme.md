Welcome to my transport application, TransitWise SG.
TransitWise SG is a mobile application designed to help users navigate Singaporeâ€™s public transport system.

To run the application, ensure that you are in the directory.

Install the required dependencies by typing

npm install

You can then run the application by typing either

npm start
or 
npx expo start

After running the command, a QR code will appear in your terminal. Scan it using the Expo Go app on your mobile device to run the app. Alternatively, you can run it using an emulator. 

Since the application is developed for the transportation systems in Singapore, it is preferred to set the emulator location in Singapore.

Latitude: 1.360577 Longitude: 103.956607

Please allow location and network use in the application to ensure that it returns the best data available.

# NOTE!!
**If running on expo snack, ensure that it is tested on the emulator for Android or IOS. Certain dependencies do not work well with the web emulator, and it will give an error. If you see an error, just switch to the IOS and Android emulator, or use an emulator of your own by running it here. Thank you**
